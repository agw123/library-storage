This a Java Basics Exercise.

Create a system to manage a library. Each book
is identified by a unique ID and has a title and author
Goal: to read the data of the books contained
in a text file (ID, name, and author) separated by a comma
save the data in a hashmap (ID will be key and you will have to
create a book object that will be the value).
Implement methods to add and remove books from the file and hashmap
then at the end of each modification, you will need to
edit the text file with the new data so the Book class, the Library class
have to be implemented along with the main that handles the operations.
